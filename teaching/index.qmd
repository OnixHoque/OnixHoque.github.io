I am currently on sabbatical from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at United International University (UIU)[^1], Bangladesh, where I served as a tenured faculty member. Before my sabbatical, I taught advanced computer science topics, including Software Engineering, Computer Architecture, and Web Programming to senior undergraduate students.

[^1]: UIU: Spring 2020 --- Current

Previously, I was a tenured faculty at Military Institute of Science and Technology (MIST)[^2] University, where I began my academic career as an adjunct faculty member. At MIST, I focused on teaching core programming concepts to undergraduate students, delivering courses in Structured Programming, Object-Oriented Programming, and Data Structures & Algorithms for nearly three years. In addition to my teaching responsibilities, I have actively contributed to various administrative roles, including serving as Postgraduate Coordinator, Secretary of the Syllabus Reform Committee, and overseeing departmental software development projects.

## Guest Lecture at Texas A&M

I delivered a guest lecture at Texas A&M University as part of the Supercomputing graduate course (CSCE-654) in Fall 2025. Over two sessions, I introduced the concept of Data-Distributed Parallel (DDP) techniques for training models on large datasets, providing hands-on demonstrations using PyTorch.

In the first session, I began by explaining how to perform interprocess communication using the PyTorch Distributed Package across multiple processes and demonstrate the ALL_REDUCE operation. We then implemented DDP from scratch to train a simple MNIST dataset using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). I also discussed strategies for adjusting the learning rate to ensure that DDP produces a consistent loss curve.

In the second session, the focus shifted to multinode DDP training. I demonstrated how to use HDF5 files to load portions of the dataset into a distributed dataloader.

The session materials are available in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/HipGraph/DDP_demo).
