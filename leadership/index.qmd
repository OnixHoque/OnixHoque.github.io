During my undergraduate studies, I served as the coordinator for the BUET System Analysis, Design, and Development (BSADD) Community. In this role, I organized and conducted a 5-day workshop on Android Mobile App Development. Additionally, I recorded the lectures and uploaded them to the official channel for wider accessibility (see [workshop website](https://sites.google.com/site/droidworkshop2016/home)).

Later, as a faculty member at MIST and UIU, I led efforts in Outcome-Based Education (OBE) and took on technical roles, steering the respective departments through various initiatives and strategic advancements. 

During my PhD, I mentored three master’s students, providing hands-on research guidance and supporting their academic and professional development.
