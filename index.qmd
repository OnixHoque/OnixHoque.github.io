## About Me

I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science & Engineering at Texas A&M University, focusing on **high-performance and distributed machine learning systems**. I specialize in optimizing **sparse linear algebra** for efficient ML pipelines. Previously, I interned at **Amazon AWS**, where I built a differentiable GPU kernel autotuner that reduced LLM kernel-tuning time from **days to hours** using transfer learning.


> I can:
>
> - Build custom **PyTorch GNN** training pipelines backed by optimized sparse linear algebra.  
> - Integrate custom **C++/CUDA** kernels into PyTorch with LibTorch & PyBind11.  
> - Develop **distributed training systems** with PyTorch Distributed and efficient disk-based data streaming.  
> - Profile and optimize Python/C++ pipelines for performance bottlenecks.  
> - Apply ML for systems optimization (e.g., neural GPU kernel autotuning).  


## Research Background

My research centers on **scalable graph learning systems** (GNNs, KGEs, GraphRAG) and custom sparse linear algebra.  
At **MLSys 2025**, I presented a generalized method for expressing KGE training models through sparse matrix multiplication to improve large-scale efficiency.  
I also built a **high-performance CPU SpMM library** (ACM WebConf 2024) that accelerates PyTorch GNN training by **up to 93×** across Intel, AMD, and ARM CPUs.  
Currently, I am collaborating with **Oak Ridge National Lab** on a distributed, differentiable framework for large-scale KGE training across hybrid compute tiers.
