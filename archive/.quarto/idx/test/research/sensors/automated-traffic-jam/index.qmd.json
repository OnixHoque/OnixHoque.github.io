Our sensor nodes collect distance and movement data and transmit them to a central server for processing. We built a network of sensors linked to a central computer that analyzes vehicle behavior and estimates traffic conditions, including the length of congestion. Throughout development, we worked to reduce noise in sonar readings, handle the variability of irregularly shaped vehicles and their unpredictable movements, and filter out interference from pedestrians and roadside vendors such as food carts.\n\n## Findings\n\nThrough our prototype implementation, we demonstrate the feasibility of using low-cost ultrasonic sensors and GSM communication to monitor real-time road conditions in complex urban environments.

We conclude that a sensor-based traffic monitoring approach offers a more responsive and context-aware alternative to conventional traffic-signal generation methods in cities like Dhaka.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"minimal\" title=\"Note\" icon=false collapse=false}\nUndergraduate Thesis Work\n\n[PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yEivuLhtMUKZcCJOkX8dfG7ecBQtFCzd/view){.btn .btn-outline-primary}\n:::\n\n![Image: Jam locations from satelite](jam.png){.lightbox}\n\n\n## Background\n\nIn this thesis, we investigate the development of a road-condition sensing and traffic-congestion detection system tailored to the unique environment of Dhaka City.
