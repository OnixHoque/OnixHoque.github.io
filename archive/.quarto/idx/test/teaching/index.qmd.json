Before my sabbatical, I taught advanced computer science topics, including Software Engineering, Computer Architecture, and Web Programming to senior undergraduate students.\n\n[^1]: UIU: Spring 2020 --- Current\n\nPreviously, I was a tenured faculty at Military Institute of Science and Technology (MIST)[^2] University, where I began my academic career as an adjunct faculty member. At MIST, I focused on teaching core programming concepts to undergraduate students, delivering courses in Structured Programming, Object-Oriented Programming, and Data Structures & Algorithms for nearly three years. In addition to my teaching responsibilities, I have actively contributed to various administrative roles, including serving as Postgraduate Coordinator, Secretary of the Syllabus Reform Committee, and overseeing departmental software development projects.\n\n\nI delivered a guest lecture at Texas A&M University as part of the Supercomputing graduate course (CSCE-654) in Fall 2025. Over two sessions, I introduced the concept of Data-Distributed Parallel (DDP) techniques for training models on large datasets, providing hands-on demonstrations using PyTorch.\n\nIn the first session, I began by explaining how to perform interprocess communication using the PyTorch Distributed Package across multiple processes and demonstrate the ALL_REDUCE operation. We then implemented DDP from scratch to train a simple MNIST dataset using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). I also discussed strategies for adjusting the learning rate to ensure that DDP produces a consistent loss curve.\n\nIn the second session, the focus shifted to multinode DDP training. I demonstrated how to use HDF5 files to load portions of the dataset into a distributed dataloader.\n\nThe session materials are available in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/HipGraph/DDP_demo).\n\n## Academic Service\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n## UIU\n\n\n### External Supervisor, FYDP-II Summer 2021\n\nNov 2021\n\nActed as an external supervisor for Final Year Design Project (FYDP) final defense presentation.\n\n### Asst Technical Coordinator, Innobotics 2020\n\nFeb 2020\n\nProvided programming related technical assistance during the competition.\n\n### Asst, OBE Revision Team\n\nJan 2021 - Present\n\nRevised two course syllabus according to new guideline.
