## Overview

[Work in progress] We are developing a distributed, differentiable sparse-matrix library designed to support model parallelism for Graph Neural Networks with very large parameters. The framework aims to improve memory efficiency and scalability across multiple devices, enabling efficient training of large-scale graph models. While still in progress, the work also lays the groundwork for future applications in sparse transformer architectures and other memory-intensive neural networks.
